# This file is responsible for configuring your application
# and its dependencies with the aid of the Mix.Config module.
use Mix.Config

# This configuration is loaded before any dependency and is restricted
# to this project. If another project depends on this project, this
# file won't be loaded nor affect the parent project.

# The following are configuration settings used by this application, with their defaults shown:

#    config :corenlp,
#      host:          "localhost",
#      base_path:     "/",
#      port:          9000,
#      recv_timeout:  30_000

# It is also possible to import configuration files, relative to this
# directory. For example, you can emulate configuration per environment
# by uncommenting the line below and defining dev.exs, test.exs and such.
# Configuration from the imported file will override the ones defined
# here (which is why it is important to import them last).
#
import_config "#{Mix.env}.exs"
